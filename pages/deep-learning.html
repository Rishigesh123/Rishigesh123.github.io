            <h2>What is Deep Learning?</h2>
            <p>Deep Learning is a highly specialized subset of Machine Learning based on artificial neural networks. The
                "deep" in deep learning refers to the multiple layers in the network. These algorithms inherently
                attempt to draw similar conclusions as humans would by continually analyzing data with a given logical
                structure.</p>
            <p>While traditional Machine Learning algorithms are linear, Deep Learning algorithms are stacked in a
                hierarchy of increasing complexity and abstraction. They power the most advanced AI applications we use
                today, from voice assistants to self-driving cars.</p>

        <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 30px; margin-top: 30px;">

                <h3>How It Links with Machine Learning</h3>
                <p>Think of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as the largest circle. Inside it is Machine Learning (ML), and
                    inside ML is Deep Learning (DL). Deep Learning is the evolution of Machine Learning.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Both rely on algorithms to process data, learn from it, and make decisions
                    without explicit
                    programming. However, Deep Learning uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain to
                    learn from vast amounts of unstructured data.</p>

                    <li><span class="highlight">Feature Extraction:</span> ML requires human intervention to extract
                        features from data. DL learns to extract these features automatically.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Data Dependency:</span> DL requires a massive amount of data to perform
                        better than traditional ML. If data is small, ML is usually preferred.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Hardware:</span> DL models require high-end machines with powerful GPUs,
                        whereas ML can be run on CPU-based machines.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Execution Time:</span> DL takes a long time to train but is extremely
                        fast during inference. ML trains quickly but can be slower at testing.</li>
